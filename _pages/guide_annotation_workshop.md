Salutations and thanks, first time!;
overview of workshop:
hands on, practical

## Principles

The MTAAC manual annotation pipeline has been designed to satisfy two criteria:
<!--
talk about that more during talk
-->

1) facilitate machine ingestion of the texts
<!--
- part of MTAAC w specific objectives
- data spacity challenge, increase repetition/ more patterns to pick-up
- practical and democratically used formats
-->
2) make the annotation process as fast as possible
<!--
- not necesserilly user friendly
    interface
    learning curve
    installtion
- Tools def can be reused ands improved for other projects
- will be integrated in the enw cdli website as services
- Stuggle to annotate fast:
  - still working on the tagset, eg why stem reduplicated?

## Basics

### Repos
#### Most useful
- Morphologically annotated texts https://github.com/cdli-gh/mtaac_gold_corpus (morph/to_dict)
- Annotation dashboard https://github.com/cdli-gh/annotation_assistant
- ATF2CoNLL converter https://github.com/cdli-gh/atf2conll-convertor
- Morphological pre-annotator https://github.com/cdli-gh/morphology-pre-annotation-tool <!-- Ilya will expalin its principles -->

### CDLI search and downlaod
<!--
useful until at least the end of the summer
talk about the new interface @ talk 
-->

- how do you use CDLI?
- advanced search overview
- search aid page
- testing out
- download ATF

### Tagsets

### Data formats
- CoNLL format

Hi and thanks 
Overview of what we will be doing
Jinyan and Ilya to introduce themselves
Intro about the basic principles and objectives of the annotation
can be extended to more later
Part of a project with specific objectives

Where to find stuff
Open access to some of the google docs
Documentation website
The repos
the links will be there so they can refer back
then showing them how to get a text from cdli
and provide them with pre-annotated texts
so they dont have to run the pre-annotator
I thnk there I would explain how the pre-annotator works
and let jinyan explain how to work with a pre-annotated text
then you can put me on and I can tell:
(1) how the morph. pre-annotation tool works 
(2) how the syntax pre-annotation tool works
and demonstrate it
yes
