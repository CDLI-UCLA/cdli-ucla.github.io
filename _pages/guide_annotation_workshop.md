Hi and thanks 
Overview of what we will be doing
Jinyan and Ilya to introduce themselves
Intro about the basic principles and objectives of the annotation
can be extended to more later
Part of a project with specific objectives

Where to find stuff
Open access to some of the google docs
Documentation website
The repos
the links will be there so they can refer back
then showing them how to get a text from cdli
and provide them with pre-annotated texts
so they dont have to run the pre-annotator
I thnk there I would explain how the pre-annotator works
and let jinyan explain how to work with a pre-annotated text
then you can put me on and I can tell:
(1) how the morph. pre-annotation tool works 
(2) how the syntax pre-annotation tool works
and demonstrate it
yes
