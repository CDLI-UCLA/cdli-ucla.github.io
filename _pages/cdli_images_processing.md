This page explains how CDLI creates, processes, stores and display digital images.

## Images capture
Images can be acquired using different hardware, such as a photo camera, a scanner or a 3D scanner. Below you can find specific instructions in using these various tools for the production of images that can be used or stored by CDLI.


### Scanning artifacts
Scanning cuneiform tablets is a very speedy and cost efficient method for image acquisition. Instructions are temporarilly availeble on CDLI Wiki: http://cdli.ox.ac.uk/wiki/doku.php?id=submission_guidelines#guidelines_for_scanning_tablets


### Photographing artifacts


### Reflectance Transformation Imaging (RTI) Dome

### Photography for photogrametry


### 3D scanning


### Scanning line art


## Processing of images



## Storage of images

### Raw / original files
At this time, CDLI will store Raw images of scanned tablets, and original photographs. We hope to be able to accept Dome raw photos, photos for fotogrametry and 3d scans raw data in the future.   

Files should be named according to the artifact they concern and to the acquisition process.  

Anyone interested in storing such images at CDLI should write to us at cdli@ucla.edu
